# Titanic Data Analysis ðŸš¢

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to explore survival patterns based on gender, passenger class, and age.  
It uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Rows:** 891
- **Columns:** Passenger demographics, ticket info, and survival outcome.

## Questions Answered
1. How many passengers survived?
2. How did gender affect survival rates?
3. Did passenger class influence survival?
4. How did age impact survival chances?
5. Average age comparison: survivors vs non-survivors.

## Key Findings
- **Women:** 74% survival rate vs 19% for men.
- **First Class:** ~63% survival vs 24% in Third Class.
- **Children under 10** had better survival odds.
- Age differences between survivors and non-survivors were small.
